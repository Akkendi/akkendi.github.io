                Hick’s Law (or the Hick-Hyman Law) is named after a British and an American psychologist team of William
                Edmund Hick and Ray Hyman. In 1952, this pair set out to examine the relationship between the number of
                stimuli present and an individual’s reaction time to any given stimulus.

                Term: Rule of Thirds
                Description: In photography, the rule of thirds is a type of composition in which an image is divided
                evenly into thirds, both horizontally and vertically, and the subject of the image is placed at the
                intersection of those dividing lines, or along one of the lines itself.

                To make sure your designs are communicating as effectively as possible, you’ll want to shake out all its
                content — even those forgotten art class concepts like color theory and composition — and use them
                strategically rather than just sticking to a few favorite or trendy techniques.
